## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/planetarium/a2x/pull/28) [`cc6b1eb`](https://github.com/planetarium/a2x/commit/cc6b1eb3bf0d77a52f5c46a4892aaae57c9f85b1) Thanks [@ost006](https://github.com/ost006)! - Emit and consume OAuth2 Device Code flow as a non-standard extension on A2A
  v0.3 AgentCards.

  Previously, `OAuth2DeviceCodeAuthorization.toV03Schema()` returned `null` and
  the scheme was silently stripped from v0.3 cards — headless/CLI clients that
  rely on device code flow could not negotiate against v0.3 peers even though
  both sides already supported it internally.

  The scheme now emits `oauth2.flows.deviceCode` on v0.3 cards (mirroring the
  v1.0 shape) and `normalizeOAuth2FlowsV03()` consumes it. OpenAPI 3.0 does
  not standardize this flow, so a warning is still logged on emission and
  strict third-party v0.3 parsers may ignore the unknown flow.

## 0.1.1
